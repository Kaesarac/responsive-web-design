# responsive-web-design
Storage for my "freecodecamp.org" learning of Responsive Web Design. Here shall be posted my training projects of HTML/CSS.

On the HTML Basics, I practice using Radio Buttons/Checkboxes, with a Mortal Kombat themed page, where you choose which character you want to fight or not fight.

On the Applied Visual Design, I personalized the previous HTML code with CSS in order to have a far more appealing page, with a Font similar to that used in the MK games, and the same color pallete.
